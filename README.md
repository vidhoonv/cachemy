CACHEMY
=======

Cachemy is an attempt to classify and organize Facebook news feed to introduce more efficiency into the social network giant.

This is a prototype to explore this idea. I used Facebook APIs extensively to fetch and control news feed. It does not contain a finished formatted product. Rather, it is just an initial version to explore the idea.

I proposed this for YCombinator startup school in 2011-12.
